# stravatogpx
The purpose of stravatogpx is to convert activities uploaded to Strava to native .gpx files which can be used for route mapping.

Simply copy the code to your machine and paste the link to the strava activity for which you want to convert into .gpx format into line 23. The activity must be 'public'.
